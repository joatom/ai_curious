It's said, that the *most effective way* to learn on kaggle is to participate in a competition and afterwards wrangling the top solutions. At the current state (as of January 2022) of my ML skills this approach doesn't work well for me.
1. Top notebook solutions are often complicated, contain implementations that are difficult to grasp or are made out of tons of ensembled models. Solutions in the discussion section contain broad overviews that are inspiring, yet hard to rebuild.
2. The solutions are often different from my own solution. It is difficult to compare them with my own code and to derive how to improve my own code.

The *second best way* to learn on kaggle is to follow the discussions and read the notebooks during a competition. This approach suites me a better, since there are often small insights to be discovered that are shared by others and that I can easily integrated in my solution. But filtering the valuable information can be hard because the notebook and discussion sections are often flooded with similar content. It is also easy to be distracted by too many different techniques and ideas.

I often enjoy the Playground competitions to focus on a few skills to improve. It is also less challenging to get a baseline implementation up running because the data is prepared to quickly get started.

In January 2022 there is a [community competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/song-popularity-prediction) hosted by Abhishek Thakur, that provides the opportunity for yet *another learning approach*. During the competition there are sessions on YouTube with two Grandmasters covering the topics *EDA* and *Imputation*. So we get high quality guidance for two important topics while working on the competition. I took the opportunity to learn along.
